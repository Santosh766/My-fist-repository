# Prediction of CO2 in gram/Kilometres
This is a model for the prediction of Carbon dioxide emission by various model with specific fuel consumption rating and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

Following steps is followed to build this model.
1. Importing the data into jupiter notebook
2. Preprocessing the data
3. Plotting the data in scatter to estimate the trend of the data.
4. Building the Linear regression model
5. Splitting the data into train & test part
6. Fitting the data in the model
7. Predicting the CO2 emission in gram/kilometres
8. Calculating the score of the model.

# R2 value is: 0.71

# Visual representation of number of the factors on which the CO2 emission(in kg) depends upon like: Engine Size, Cylinder, Fuel Consumption etc.
